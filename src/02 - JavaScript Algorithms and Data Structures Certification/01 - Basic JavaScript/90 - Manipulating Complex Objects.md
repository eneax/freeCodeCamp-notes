# Manipulating Complex Objects

JavaScript objects are a great way to store data in a `flexible` Data Structure, since they allow us to arbitrary combine strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and other objects.

Example:

```js
var myMusicLibrary = [
  {
    artist: "Billy Joel",
    title: "Piano Man",
    release_year: 1973,
    formats: ["CD", "8T", "LP"],
    gold: true
  },
  {
    artist: "Eminem",
    title: "Encore",
    release_year: 2004,
    formats: ["CD", "8T", "LP"],
    gold: true
  }
];
```
