# Inform with the Paragraph Element

`p` elements are the preferred element for paragraph text on websites. `p` is short for "paragraph".

You can create a paragraph element like this:

```html
<p>I'm a p tag!</p>
```

**Note**: As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase, for example `<p></p>` and not `<P></P>`.
