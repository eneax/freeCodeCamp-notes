# Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

In JavaScript, we can divide our code into `reusable parts` called `functions`.

In order to create a function, we use the reserved keyword `function`, followed by the name we want to give to that function, like `reusableFunction()` and a set of curly braces.

The code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

We can call or `invoke` a function by using its name followed by parentheses, like: `reusableFunction();`.

Example:

```js
function reusableFunction() {
  console.log("🙋‍♂️ 🌎");
}

reusableFunction();
```
