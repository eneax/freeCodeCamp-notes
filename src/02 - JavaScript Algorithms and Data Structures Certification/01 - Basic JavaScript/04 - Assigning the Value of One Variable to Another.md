# Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another

After a value is assigned to a variable using the assignment operator (`=`), you can assign the value of that variable to another variable using the assignment operator.

Example:

```js
var a;
a = 7;

var b;
b = a;
```

Now, `b` also has the value of `7`.
