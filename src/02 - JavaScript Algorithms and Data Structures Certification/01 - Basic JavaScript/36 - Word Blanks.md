# Word Blanks

The code block below illustrates an example of string concatenation using the `+` operator in order to build a complete sentence as a new string.

Example:

```js
var myNoun = "dog";
var myAdjective = "big";
var myVerb = "ran";
var myAdverb = "quickly";

var wordBlanks =
  "When I saw a " +
  myAdjective +
  " mad " +
  myNoun +
  ", I " +
  myVerb +
  " very " +
  myAdverb;
```
