# Access Array Data with Indexes

Data stored within arrays can be accessed using bracket notation and indexes.

Just like `strings`, arrays use `zero-based` indexing, that's why the first element in an array has an index of 0. Indexes, however, are used to specify and entry in the array; instead of a character (like in strings).

Example:

```js
var myArray = [50, 60, 70];

var firstValue = myArray[0];
```
