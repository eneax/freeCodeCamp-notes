# Comment Your JavaScript Code

Comments represent code that the JavaScript engine ignores completely. You can write comments in any place of your code block, since they do not affect the execution of the script.

They represent a great way to describe what the code does to give more insights on the complex areas of your codebase. You can leave comments also to remind yourself or other developers to refactor some particular functions in the near future, or simply to temporarily disable a part of code.

Two ways to leave comments in JavaScript:
- single line:
```js
// This is an in-line comment.
```

- multiline:
```js
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```
