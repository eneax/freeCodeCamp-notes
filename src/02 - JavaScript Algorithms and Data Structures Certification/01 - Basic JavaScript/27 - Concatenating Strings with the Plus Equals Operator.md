# Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator

We can concatenate strings together also by using the `+=` operator.
This practice can be very helpful if we have to break a long string over several lines or to perform string manipulations using JavaScript.

```js
var myStringVariable = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStringVariable += "This is the second sentence.";
```
