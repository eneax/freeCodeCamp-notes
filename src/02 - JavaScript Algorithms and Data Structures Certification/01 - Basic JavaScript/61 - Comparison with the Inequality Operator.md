# Comparison with the Inequality Operator

The inequality operator (`!=`) is the opposite of the equality operator.
It means 'Not Equal' and it returns `false` in the cases where the equality operator would return `true`.

Moreover, just like the equality operator, the inequality operator performs a `type conversion` while comparing.

Examples:

```js
1 != 2; // true
1 != "1"; // false
1 != true; // false
```
