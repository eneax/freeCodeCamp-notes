# Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

In programming, we use assignments to modify the content of a variable.
Moreover, other than assigning a new value, we saw also how to perform basic mathematical operation.

In JavaScript, we can combine a mathematical operator and the assignment operator and obtain a new operator used for augmented addition `+=`:

```js
var myFavoriteNumber = 1;
myFavoriteNumber += 16;
console.log(myVar); // 17
```
