# Practice comparing different values

We can summarize the difference between `==` and `===` in the following example:

```js
3 == "3"; // returns true because JavaScript converts the value on the right of the operator from string to number
3 === "3"; // returns false because the types are different and JavaScript does not perform type conversion
```
