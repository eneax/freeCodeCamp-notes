# Say Hello to HTML Elements

This is an HTML element:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.

Opening tags look like this: `<h1>`, and closing tags look like this: `</h1>`.
As you can see, the only difference between opening and closing tags is the **forward slash** after the opening bracket of a closing tag.
