# Constructing Strings with Variables

In JavaScript, we can use the `+` operator not only to concatenate `Strings`, but also to build a new string by inserting one or more variables into it.

Example:

```js
var myName = "Enea";
var myAge = 28;

var myCustomString =
  "Hi, my name is " + myName + " and I am " + myAge + " years old!";
// "Hi, my name is Enea and I am 28 years old!"
```
