# Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

A **pseudo-class** is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element. For instance, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its **hover state** using the `:hover` pseudo-class selector.

Example:

```html
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }
  a:hover {
    color: #00f;
  }
</style>
