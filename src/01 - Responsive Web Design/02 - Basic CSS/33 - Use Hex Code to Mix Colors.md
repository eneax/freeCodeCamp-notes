# Use Hex Code to Mix Colors

**Hex codes** use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over 16 million other colors!

For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500.
The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.
The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: #ff0000;
  }
  .green-text {
    color: #00ff00;
  }
  .dodger-blue-text {
    color: #1e90ff;
  }
  .orange-text {
    color: #ffa500;
  }
</style>

<h1 class="red-text">I am red!</h1>

<h1 class="green-text">I am green!</h1>

<h1 class="dodger-blue-text">I am dodger blue!</h1>

<h1 class="orange-text">I am orange!</h1>
```
