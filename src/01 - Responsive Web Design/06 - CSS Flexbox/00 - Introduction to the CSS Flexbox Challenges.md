# Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges

A website's User Interface ("UI") has two components:

- visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and images Second, there is the
- placement or positioning of those elements.

In Responsive Web Design, a UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices accessing the content.

CSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or **flexbox**, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers.All popular modern browsers support flexbox.
