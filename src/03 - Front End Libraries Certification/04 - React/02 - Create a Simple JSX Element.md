# Create a Simple JSX Element

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. 

Benefits: 
- it helps to keep your code readable
- it lets you write JavaScript within HTML (simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces)

```jsx
{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }
```

or

```jsx
const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;
```
