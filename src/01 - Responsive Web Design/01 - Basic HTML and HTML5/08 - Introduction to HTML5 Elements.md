# Introduction to HTML5 Elements

**HTML5** introduces more descriptive HTML tags: `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `video`, `article`, `section` and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (**SEO**) and **accessibility**.

Example:

```html
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<main>
  <p>
    Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
    attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass
    sniff.
  </p>

  <p>
    Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere
    rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.
  </p>
</main>
```
