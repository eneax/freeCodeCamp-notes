# Headline with the h2 Element

The `h2` element adds a level two heading to the web page.

This element tells the browser about the structure of your website.
`h1` elements are often used for main headings, while `h2` elements are generally used for subheadings.
There are also `h3`, `h4`, `h5` and `h6` elements to indicate different levels of subheadings.
