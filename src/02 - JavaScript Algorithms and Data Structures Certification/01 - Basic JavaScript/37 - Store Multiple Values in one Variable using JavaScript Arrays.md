# Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

`Arrays` are JavaScript variables that we use to store several pieces of data in one single place.
We declare arrays with an opening and closing square bracket `[]` and and separate each entry inside with a comma:

```js
var myArray = ["Enea", 28];
```
