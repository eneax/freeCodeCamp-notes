# Introduction to JavaScript

The early days, when JavaScript was simply making a page come alive are gone.
Today, JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language (according to [Github](https://octoverse.github.com) and [Stack Overflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019)).

JavaScript, a high-level programming language, is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS and it's being used in fields that go beyond the web, like machine learning, virtual reality and even in robotics and IoT platforms like [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io).
