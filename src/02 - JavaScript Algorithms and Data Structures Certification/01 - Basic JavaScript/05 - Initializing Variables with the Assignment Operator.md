# Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

Although you can declare a variable and subsequently assign a value to it, it is common to initialize a variable to an initial value at the moment when it is declared.

```js
var myNumber = 0;
```

The code above creates a new variable called `myNumber` and assigns it an initial value of 0.
