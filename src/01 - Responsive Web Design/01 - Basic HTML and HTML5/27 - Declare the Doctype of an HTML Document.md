# Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document

At the top of your document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using.
While most major browsers support the latest specification (`HTML5`), older web pages may use previous versions of the language.

You tell the browser this information by adding the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag on the first line, where the `html` specifies the version of HTML (`HTML5`). The `!` and uppercase `DOCTYPE` is important, especially for older browsers.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Title</h1>
</html>
```
