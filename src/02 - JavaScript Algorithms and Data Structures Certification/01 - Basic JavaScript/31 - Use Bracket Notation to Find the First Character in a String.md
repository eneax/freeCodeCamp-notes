# Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

In JavaScript, we use `bracket notation` to get a character at a specific index within a string. Moreover, instead of starting to count at 1, we start at 0. This is referred to as `Zero-based indexing`.

```js
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Xharja";

firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0]; // "X"
```

For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].
