# Introduction to Basic CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (`CSS`) tells the browser how to display the text and other content that we write in HTML.
Basically, it's what makes a webpage look nice!

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

- color
- fonts
- positioning
- spacing
- sizing
- decorations
- transitions

There are three main ways to apply CSS styling:

1. we can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the style attribute
2. we can place CSS rules within `style` tags in an HTML document
3. we can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document.

The idea behind CSS is that you can use a `selector` to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.
