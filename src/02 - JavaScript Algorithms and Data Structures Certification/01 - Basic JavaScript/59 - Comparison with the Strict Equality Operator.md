# Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator

While the equality operator (`==`) converts both values that we want to compare to a common type, the strict equality operator (`===`) does not perform a type conversion.

Example:

```js
17 === 17; // true
17 === "17"; // false
```

In the second example, `17` is a `Number` type and `'17'` is a String type; so the strict equality operator considers them unequal.

JS Tip: == vs ===

When writing software, the simpler solution is almost always the better one. If in order to use a feature I first have to learn and remember a list of rules pertaining to it, I try my best to avoid it. Not because that feature might not be valuable to know, but because I don‚Äôt trust myself to remember every nuanced rule. That logic is the primary decision to why I always use triple equals (===) over double equals (==). They both accomplish similar things, but the Pit of Success for triple equals is much larger, let‚Äôs see why.

### Identity Operator (triple equals, ===)

When using triple equals ===, there are two rules you need to remember - strict equality (for when you‚Äôre comparing primitive values) and reference equality (for when you‚Äôre comparing reference values).

### Strict Equality

Strict equality checks that both the type (number, string, boolean, etc) and the value are the same. If the type is the same but not the value, you‚Äôll get false. If the value is the same but not the type, you‚Äôll get false. If both the value and the type are the same, you‚Äôll get true.

```js
5 === 5; // true. Same type, same value.
5 === 4; // false. Same type, different values.
5 === "5"; // false. Different type, same value.

true === true; // true. Same type, same value.
true === false; // false. Same type, different values.
true === "true"; // false. Different type, same value.
```

Seems simple enough, but as mentioned earlier this rule breaks down when we start to compare reference values (or values that aren‚Äôt primitives).

### Reference Equality

As we saw in the previous example, primitives are compared by their value. However, if you use triple equals with reference values, it‚Äôs going to compare the references (or spots in memory).

```js
{} === {} // false. Same type, similar value, different reference. ‚ùå
[] === [] // false. Same type, similar value, different reference. ‚ùå
{ name: 'Meg' } === { name: 'Meg' } // false. Same type, similar value, different reference. ‚ùå
```

Even though each of the examples above has the same type and what appears to be the same value, because they‚Äôre reference values, JavaScript compares the references in memory, not the actual value. In each of the examples the references or locations in memory are different, which is why we always get false.

We can see this further by assigning two variable to the same reference in memory and then using the identity operator on them.

```js
const user = {
  name: "Tyler"
};

const person = user;

person === user; // true. Same type, same value, same reference.
```

In the example both person and user are referencing the same spot in memory, which is why we get true.

In summary, when using the Identity Operator (===), assuming you know about reference equality, everything just works as you‚Äôd expect. Here‚Äôs an equality table to prove it.

### Equality Operator (double equals, ==)

Unlike the Identity Operator (===), unless you‚Äôre very familiar with it, odds are the Equality Operator (==) doesn‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd expect. Here are just some examples,

```js
"1" == 1; // true
null == undefined; // true
0 == ""; // true
("0" == false[1]) == // true
  true; // true ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```

So what exactly is going on here? Notice that each comparison is being made between different types. As we saw earlier with the Identity Operator (===), all of these would return false since they‚Äôre all of different types. With the Equality Operator (==), it‚Äôs not that simple. Instead of returning false when the types don‚Äôt match, it‚Äôll attempt to convert them into the same type.

So in the first example, "1" == 1 because the JavaScript engine will convert the String ‚Äú1‚Äù to Number 1 which then evaluates to 1 == 1 which is true.

It‚Äôs that type coercion stage which makes the Equality Operator (==) so unpredictable. Here‚Äôs the same equality table we saw before except now in terms of ==.

If you and anyone who works on your codebase is confident in all of JavaScript‚Äôs type coercion rules, feel free to use whichever operator you‚Äôd like. However, if you‚Äôre like me and you‚Äôd rather use the tool that works how you‚Äôd expect, stick with the Identity Operator (===).
