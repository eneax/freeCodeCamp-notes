# Declare JavaScript Variables

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data. You can think of a variable as a simple and shorter name that we use to represent the data we want to refer to, kind of like the `x` and `y` in mathematics.

Computer variables, however, can store not only numbers, but different values at different times.
JS has eight different data types: `undefined`, `null`, `boolean`, `string`, `symbol`, `bigint`, `number` and `object`. Any of the above eight data types can be stored in a variable.

In JavaScript, we can create or `declare` a variable by using the magical keyword `var` in front of it:

```js
var myName;
var myPhoneNumber;
```

The code above creates two variables: `myName` and `myPhoneNumber`.

Notice also how each statement, a list of 'instruction' that we give to a computer to 'execute', ends with a `semicolons`.

To declare a variable, you can use `numbers`, `letters`, and `$` or `_`, but not `spaces` or make a variable start with a number.
