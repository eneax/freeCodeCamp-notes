# Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

We've seen how to use the `+` operator in order to add numbers.
In JavaScript, however, we can use the `+` operator also inside a `String` value, and in that case it's called `concatenation operator`.

This operator is very helpful to concatenate together multiple strings in order to build a new one.

```js
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
// "This is the start. This is the end."
```
