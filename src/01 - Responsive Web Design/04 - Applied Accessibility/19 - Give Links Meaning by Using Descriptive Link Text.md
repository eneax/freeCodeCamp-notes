# Give Links Meaning by Using Descriptive Link Text

Screen reader users have different options for what type of content their device reads. This includes skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary from the headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.

Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (`a`) tags. Having a list of "_click here_" or "_read more_" links isn't helpful. Instead, you should use brief but descriptive text within the a tags to provide more meaning for these users.

Example:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
  </header>
  <article>
    <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
    <p>
      Felines the world over have been waging war on the most persistent of
      foes. This red nemesis combines both cunning stealth and lightning speed.
      But chin up, fellow fighters, our time for victory may soon be near. Click

    </p>
  </article>
</body>
