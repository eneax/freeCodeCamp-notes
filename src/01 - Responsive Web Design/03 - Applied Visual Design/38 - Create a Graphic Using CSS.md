# Create a Graphic Using CSS

By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the `box-shadow` property that sets the shadow of an element, along with the `border-radius` property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.

You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is actually going to be the moon shape you see.

```html
<style>
  .center {
    position: absolute;
    margin: auto;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: transparent;
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 25px 10px 0px 0px blue;
  }
</style>
<div class="center"></div>
```
