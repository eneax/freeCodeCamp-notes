#Â Introduction to the Redux Challenges

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

It has four key features:

1. Predictable

It makes applications behave consistently in different environments, plus they are easy to test.

2. Centralized

The state of your application is stored in one central place.

3. Debuggable

Thanks to the Redux DevTools, we can easily inspect and track how the state of our application changes.

4. Flexible

Redux can be used with any UI library, not only React. Also, we have at disposal a large ecosystem of addons to satisfy any need.
