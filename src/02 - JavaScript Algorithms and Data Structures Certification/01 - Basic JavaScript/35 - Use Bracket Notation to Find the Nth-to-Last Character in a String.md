# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

In the same way we calculated the last character in a string, we can retrieve also the Nth-to-last character.

Example:

```js
var lastName = "Xharja";

var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2]; // "j"
```
