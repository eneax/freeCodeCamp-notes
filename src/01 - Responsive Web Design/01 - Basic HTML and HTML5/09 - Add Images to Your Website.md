# Add Images to Your Website

You can add images to your website by using the `img` element, and point to a specific image's URL using the `src` **attribute**. Note that img elements are self-closing.

All `img` **elements** must have an `alt` **attribute**. The text inside an `alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

```html
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="Relaxing cat" />
  <p>
    Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching
    attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass
    sniff.
  </p>
  <p>
    Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere
    rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.
  </p>
</main>
