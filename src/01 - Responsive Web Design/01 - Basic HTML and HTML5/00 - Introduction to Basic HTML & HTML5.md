# Introduction to Basic HTML & HTML5

HyperText Markup Language, or **HTML**, is a markup language that describes the structure of a web page.
It uses a special syntax to organize and give information about the page to the browser.
**Elements** usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to the content.

HTML comes from the early days of the web. Pages usually contained static documents that contained references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user could read the reference document without having to manually search for it.

As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the **W3 Consortium** updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is **HTML5**.

Example:

```html
<h1>I'm the page title</h1>

<p>
  A paragraph of text. It can be as long or short as we would like.
</p>
```
