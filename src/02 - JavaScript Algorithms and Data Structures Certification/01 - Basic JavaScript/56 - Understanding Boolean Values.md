# Understanding Boolean Values

A `Boolean` is a JavaScript data type that can have only two values: `true` or `false`.
These two states are `mutually exclusive` and therefore, they cannot both occur at the same time.

Example:

```js
function welcomeToBooleans() {
  return true;
}
```

Note: `Boolean` values are never written with quotes.
