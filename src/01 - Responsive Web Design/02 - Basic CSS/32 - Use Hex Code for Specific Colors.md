# Use Hex Code for Specific Colors

There are other ways to represent colors in CSS. One of these ways is called **hexadecimal** code, or hex code for short.

We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit. Hexadecimals (or hex) are base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, giving us 16 total possible values.

In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors: two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value.

Example:

```css
body {
  background-color: #000000;
}
```
