# Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

`Bracket Notation` allows us to make also some basic logic and find the last letter of a string. We can do it by subtracting one from the string's length.

Example:

```js
var lastName = "Xharja";

var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1]; // "a"
```
