# Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation

There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (`.`) and bracket notation (`[]`).

`Dot notation` is used particularly when we already know in advance the name of the property we're trying to access.

Example:

```js
var clothes = {
  shirt: "jersey",
  shoes: "cleats"
};

var shirtValue = clothes.shirt;
var shoesValue = clothes.shoes;
```
